By exercising the Licensed Rights (see section "2. Uses and Reproductions"), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of Your agreement to be bound by these terms and conditions.

SECTION 1 – DEFINITIONS.

1. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or any other type of work that incorporates copyright protection, but not including a Collection. For clarity, where the Work is a musical work, the synchronization or reproduction of a portion of the Work in timed relation with images or moving pictures is an Adaptation.
2. "Collection" means a collection, compilation, anthology, encyclopedia or the like, in which the Work, taken as a whole, is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. For clarity, a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this Public License.
3. "Commercial Purposes" means to use, license, sublicense, sell, lease, lend, trade or otherwise exploit for any commercial or private monetary or other consideration, the Work or Collection, or any adaptations or Collections that You create, prepare, modify, translate, publish, perform, display and/or distribute based upon, derived from, or incorporating the Work.
4. "Copyright" means all copyright rights, however also designated, comprising copyright, neighboring and related rights, and sui generis rights, as defined by copyright laws of any jurisdiction throughout the world.
5. "Copyright and Similar Rights" means Copyright and/or Similar Rights.
6. "Effective Technological Measures" means those measures that, in the absence of proper authorization, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements. When applied to Collections, however, the definition applies only to such Effective Technological Measures as, if any, the licensor of the Work has applied to such Collection as a condition for permitting the inclusion of the Work in such Collection.
7. "License Elements" means the licensing conditions and terms granted for any version of the Public License published by Creative Commons. The applicable License Elements for this Public License are contained in 4.0 International.
8. "Licensed Material" means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
9. "Licensed Rights" means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License.
10. "Licensor" means the individual(s) and/or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.
11. "Share" means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the applicable Copyright and Similar Rights, such as distribution, public display, public performance, or to make available for any such use or purpose, as determined by Copyright and Similar Rights.
12. "Sui Generis Database Rights" means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
13. "You" means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. "Your" has a corresponding meaning.
14. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this Public License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression, including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet, article, journal, essay, short story, poem, play, screenplay, motion picture, radio or television program, musical composition, musical arrangement, choreography, painting, drawing, etching, sculpture, architecture, photograph, portrait, tapestry, lithograph, advertisement, map, chart, diagram, model, software, computer program, database, compilation, any other literary or artistic creation, and any other work in which copyright can subsist. (Hereinafter "Work" refers to original copyright work and/or sui generis database right).

SECTION 2 – SCOPE.

2.1. License grant.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material for the duration of copyright and similar rights in the Licensed Material:

    to reproduce, distribute, and make available to the public the Licensed Material in any form or medium, whether now known or to be developed in the future;

    to create, reproduce, distribute, and make available to the public adaptations of the Licensed Material.
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or to be developed in the future. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make adaptations. Subject to Section 8(f), you do not have the right to collect royalty fees from users for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or by way of a right of remuneration pursuant to legislation or by other means.

2.2. Exceptions and Limitations.

For the sake of clarity, where the Work is a database, certain rights granted under this Public License that would otherwise be covered by the Database Directive will not apply.

3.1. Licensed Rights.

The grant of the Licensed Rights under this Public License is expressly conditioned upon compliance with the following conditions:

    Attribution — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the Licensor endorses you or your use.
    NonCommercial — You may not use the material for commercial purposes.

    ShareAlike — If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.
3.2. No downstream restrictions.

You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if it restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

3.3. Subsequent Licenses.

You may not offer or procure the grant of any other licenses (including an open source license) on the Licensed Material except as expressly permitted in this Public License.

3.4. Limitations, Exceptions, and Defenses.

Nothing in this Public License intends to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in copyright law.

3.5. Public License Scope.

The scope of this Public License is limited to Copyright and Similar Rights. Insofar as the Licensed Material is a database and is protected by copyright and/or sui generis database rights, the Licensor grants You the rights in the Licensed Material only to the extent that they are covered by the terms of this Public License.

SECTION 4 – SUBLICENSES.

The Licensed Rights and the Licensed Material cannot be sublicensed except with the written permission from the Licensor.

SECTION 5 – DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.

The Licensed Material is being provided to You "AS IS", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including, but not limited to, warranties that the Licensed Material is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality, accuracy, completeness, and validity of the Licensed Material is with You. Should the Licensed Material prove defective in any manner whatsoever, You bear the entire cost of any service, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranties constitutes an essential part of this Public License. No use of any of the trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features. Nothing in this Public License shall be deemed to exclude, restrict or limit the Licensor’s liability in any jurisdiction to the extent that such liability may not be excluded or limited by law.

SECTION 6 – EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY.

6.1. To the Maximum Extent Permitted by Applicable Law, in no event will Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Work, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in any jurisdiction for any or all of these liability types, the Licensor’s liability shall be limited to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law in such jurisdiction.

6.2. The exclusion or limitation of liability as set forth in Section 6.1 shall not apply to liability resulting from the grossly negligent conduct, fraud or intentional misconduct of the Licensor. However, nothing in this Public License does not preclude claims for negligence, and gives You any defenses that may be available pursuant to the contributory negligence, assumption of risk, or any other common law doctrine.

7.1. Termination.

This Public License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this Public License.

7.2. Effect of Termination of License.

Upon termination of this Public License, all legal rights that were necessary for Licensor, subject to the termination of this Public License, to enforce this Public License shall survive such termination.

8.1. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor offers to the public the right to use the Work under the terms of this Public License (his/her “Initial Offer”). The Licensor reserves the right to terminate his/her offer on the event of:

    a. the United States’ withdrawal from the Berne Convention or the WIPO Copyright Treaty; or

    b. the passing of any legislation in the Licensor’s jurisdiction which has a material adverse effect on his/her ability to not comply with this Public License; or

    c. a judicial decision in the Licensor’s jurisdiction which has a material adverse effect on his/her ability to not comply with this Public License.
This termination shall be effective two (2) months after the effective date of the event that gave rise to such termination. In such event, all licenses granted under this Public License shall be terminated. This termination right shall supplement, and not replace, any other termination right that the Licensor may have, now or in the future.

8.2. In the event of any termination of this Public License for any reason:

    a. the Licensor shall offer, if possible, any future grant for the Public License without terminating his/her Initial Offer as set forth in Section 8(a); and

    b. the Licensor’s previous offer of the Work under the terms of this Public License shall remain terminated subject to the passage of time, so that, if the condition precedent to such termination is removed, the termination is lifted and the Licensor’s offer for the Work is reinstated.
For the avoidance of doubt, the expiry or termination of this Public License shall not affect any right, duty or liability incurred or accrued prior to the date of expiry or termination.

SECTION 9 – MISCELLANEOUS.

9.1. Severability.

If any provision of this Public License is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and the remaining provisions of this Public License shall remain in full force and effect.

9.2. Waiver.

No term or provision of this Public License will be considered waived, and no breach consented to, unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

9.3. Entire Agreement.

This Public License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. There are no understandings, agreements, representations or warranties, express or implied, not specified herein relating to the subject matter hereof.

Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Nevertheless, Creative Commons may seek to intervene in an instance where a third party challenges the legality of its public licenses.
